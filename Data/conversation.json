Let's go through them again, and I'll help you understand the correct answers.\n\nYou initially got Q1 incorrect, but now you have a chance to understand it better. The correct answer is C) Anthocyanin. Anthocyanin is the pigment responsible for the red, purple, and blue colors of many fruits and vegetables, including apples.\n\nYou got Q2 correct, which is great! The flesh of the apple fruit is responsible for its sweetness.\n\nIn Q3, you initially answered A) Ripening, but the correct answer is B) Senescence. Senescence refers to the process of apples becoming overripe and soft.\n\nYou got Q4 correct, which is excellent! Granny Smith apples are indeed known for their green skin and tart taste.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these topics, feel free to ask!"
